ClassDB was developed at the Data Science & Systems Lab ([DASSL](http://sites.wcsu.edu/murthys/research/dassl/), read _dazzle_) at the Western Connecticut State University ([WCSU](http://wcsu.edu/)).

ClassDB was conceived and designed by [Sean Murthy](http://sites.wcsu.edu/murthys/), a member of the Computer Science faculty at WCSU. A large portion of ClassDB was implemented by [Andrew Figueroa](https://github.com/afig) and [Steven Rollo](https://github.com/srrollo), undergraduate students at WCSU.

The development of ClassDB was aided by the generous licensing policies of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com).

The ClassDB license policy was created using the free licensing framework by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/).
