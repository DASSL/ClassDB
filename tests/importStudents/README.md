The file `testBannerRoster.csv` ("test file") is a sample CSV-formatted file containing a roster the way the [Elucian Banner](http://www.ellucian.com/student-information-system/) system generates at WCSU.

The column names, number, data types, and data sizes ("the structure") in the test file are representative of a roster at WCSU.

The data in the test file is not an actual roster. The content of every cell is fabricated to match the structure the Banner system generates at WCSU.

It is possible the structure of a roster at another university (even if they use the Banner system) is quite different. Specifically, anticipate that column name, number of columns, column order, and data size to be different. For example, the column name `WCSU EMail` is virtually guaranteed to be different at another university.
