# ClassDB

ClassDB is an open-source database application to help instructors provide students an environment to experiment with relational data. With ClassDB, each student gets their own space (think _schema_) with all rights to that space. The instructor is able to read from any student's space, but no student has access to another student's space. Further, the instructor can create additional common spaces with selected rights for students.

Instructors can use ClassDB to accept class assignments and term projects in both introductory courses on data management and upper-level courses where students program against a database.

The [ClassDB web site](https://dassl.github.io/ClassDB/) has up-to-date documentation. Here are links to selected pages:
